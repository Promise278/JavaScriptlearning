// The confirm() function in JavaScript is used to show a popup dialog that asks the user to confirm an action (like deleting a note). It displays a message with two buttons: “OK” and “Cancel.”
confirm("Are you sure you want to delete this note?");

// What It Does:
// When the user clicks “OK”, confirm() returns true.

// When the user clicks “Cancel”, it returns false.
